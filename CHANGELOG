# Changelog

## 0.3.0
- Make a demo that works on its own, from this repository with a small Node express.js that serves both the static client and a simple API that stores data in memory.
- Fix setting the value of the SubmitButton component.

## v0.2.1
- response should be response.json() instead of just response.
- On each form field, switch from value to defaultValue because that's best practice in React forms.

## v0.2.0
- Remove Axios and use the native ES6 fetch instead, to reduce the size of the build. is-buffer, a dependency of axios, is especially big. See this article on [Axios vs fetch](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/fetch-vs-axios-js-for-making-http-requests-2b261cdd3af5).

## v0.1.0
- First version of the ReactLogin component.
